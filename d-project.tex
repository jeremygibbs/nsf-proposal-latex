\section{Introduction}
\label{intro}
The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know My name is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee.

Check it, Alex, I embarrassed him in front of his children and the world by
healing at a pace that his unevolved mind can't process. Okay ... last I
checked, Chaim, I've spent close to the last decade, I don't know,
effortless and magically converting your tin cans into pure gold. They urge
you to put down your sword and come join the winners. In 22 years the only
'winners' I could locate in their toothless warren were either driving a
convertible van or living like trolls under an abandoned bridge.  He's as
radical as you'd think he'd might be. If ... I'm not just my dad, I'm ...

'courage'.

\section{Research Methodology}
A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. I suggest you drop it, Mr. Data. Wouldn't that bring about chaos? Ensign Babyface! We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. I guess it's better to be lucky than good. I am your worst nightmare! Well, I'll say this for him - he's sure of himself. Damage report! What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? Congratulations - you just destroyed the Enterprise. About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named "Enterprise." Your shields were failing, sir.

Lorem Khaled Ipsum is a major key to success. To be successful you've got to work hard, to make history, simple, you've got to make it. The first of the month is coming, we have to get money, we have no choice. It cost money to eat and they don't want you to eat. Fan luv. 

Surround yourself with angels, positive energy, beautiful people, beautiful souls, clean heart, angel. You smart, you loyal, you a genius. Give thanks to the most high. We the best. I told you all this before, when you have a swimming pool, do not use chlorine, use salt water, the healing, salt water is the healing.

In life there will be road blocks but we will over come it. The other day the grass was brown, now it's green because I ain't give up. Never surrender. You do know, you do know that they don't want you to have lunch. I'm keeping it real with you, so what you going do is have lunch. Don't ever play yourself. 

We don't see them, we will never see them. I'm up to something. Surround yourself with angels, positive energy, beautiful people, beautiful souls, clean heart.

\section{Scientific Merit}

You wanna know how I got these scars? My father was... a drinker, and a fiend. And one night, he goes off crazier than usual. Mommy gets the kitchen knife to defend herself. He doesn't like that, not one bit. So, me watching he takes the knife to her, laughing while he does it. He turns to me and he says: "Why so serious?". He comes at me with the knife "Why so serious?". He sticks the blade in my mouth. "Let's put a smile on that face." and... Why so serious?

\section{Broader Impacts of the Proposed Work}
\label{broadimpacts}
\vspace*{-8pt}

This project will have direct impacts on research and education through access to simulation data products, student training, and K-12 outreach.  

\vspace{4pt}
\noindent \underline{\textit{Data Access}}: Maybe write about you will make data available.

\vspace{4pt}
\noindent \underline{\textit{Student Training}}: Write about how you will train students.

\vspace{4pt}
\noindent \underline{\textit{Some Other Outreach}}: Write about more outreach.

\vspace{4pt}
\noindent \underline{\textit{Dissemination}}: Write about how you will disseminate results (i.e., journal articles, workshops, etc).

\section{Results from Prior NSF Support}

\noindent \emph{\underline{Person One}}: No NSF support in the past five years \newline

\noindent The most relevant prior NSF award to the proposed project for \underline{Person Two} (Co-PI) is: (a) NSF PDM \#\#\#\#\#\#\#, \$000,000, MM/DD/YY to MM/DD/YY; (b) Title: Super Cool Project That Got Funded; (c) Accomplishments related to the {\bf intellectual merit} of this research project include something something. The {\bf broader impacts} include outreach at many levels. Something Something. To date, the grant has funded one post-doc and 1000 graduate students. The project has also involved 500 undergraduate students. (d) To date this project has resulted in 100 conference presentations, one million journal publications (cite them) with one under review (cite it) and two in preparation with well-developed drafts.
